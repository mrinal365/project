<p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly shortened to Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 novel written by English author 
Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll.[1] It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole 
into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting 
popularity with adults as well as with children.[2] It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense 
genre.[2][3] Its narrative course, structure, characters, and imagery have been enormously influential[3] in both popular 
culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.
