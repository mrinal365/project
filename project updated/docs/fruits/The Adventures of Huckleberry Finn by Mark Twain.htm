<p>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (or, in more recent editions, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) is a novel by Mark Twain, 
first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. Commonly named among the 
Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular 
English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, the narrator of 
two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective) and a friend of Tom Sawyer. It is a direct sequel to The 
Adventures of Tom Sawyer.</p>
