<p>Crime and Punishment (Pre-reform Russian: Преступленіе и наказаніе; post-reform Russian: Преступление и наказание, tr. 
Prestupléniye i nakazániye, IPA: [prʲɪstʊˈplʲenʲɪje ɪ nəkɐˈzanʲɪje]) is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. It 
was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866.[1] It was later 
published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoevsky's full-length novels following his return from 5 years of exile 
in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the first great novel of his "mature" period of writing.[2]
