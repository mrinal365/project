<p>The tomato is the edible, often red, berry of the nightshade Solanum lycopersicum, 
commonly known as a tomato plant. The species originated in western South America. 
The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, 
from which the English word tomato derived. Its use as a cultivated food may have originated 
with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.[2][5] The Spanish discovered the tomato from their 
contact with the Aztec during the Spanish colonization of the Americas and brought it to Europe. 
From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.
