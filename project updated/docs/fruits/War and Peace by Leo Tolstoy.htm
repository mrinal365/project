<p>War and Peace (pre-reform Russian: Война и миръ; post-reform Russian: Война и мир, translit. Vojna i mir [vɐjˈna i ˈmʲir]) is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy. It is regarded as a central work of world literature and one of Tolstoy's finest literary achievements.[1][2][3]
The novel chronicles the history of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society 
through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805,[4] were 
serialized in The Russian Messenger from 1865 to 1867. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1869.[5]
