<p>TLolita is a 1955 novel written by Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov. Many authors consider it the greatest work 
of the 20th century,[2] and it has been included in several lists of best books, such as Time's List of the 100 Best Novels, 
Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century, Bokklubben World Library and The Big Read. The novel is notable for its controversial 
subject: the protagonist and unreliable narrator, a middle-aged literature professor under the pseudonym Humbert Humbert, is 
obsessed with a 12-year-old girl, Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather. 
"Lolita" is his private nickname for Dolores. The novel was originally written in English and first published in Paris in 
1955 by Olympia Press. Later it was translated into Russian by Nabokov himself and published in New York City in 1967 by 
Phaedra Publishers.
